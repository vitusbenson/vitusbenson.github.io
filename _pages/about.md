Hi Friend, great to have you here! :sparkles:

I am Vitus, currently an ELLIS PhD candidate at [Max-Planck-Institute for Biogeochemistry](https://bgc-jena.mpg.de), [ELLIS Unit Jena](https://ellis-jena.ai/) and [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://sml.inf.ethz.ch/). I am conducting my research under the supervision of [Markus Reichstein](https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/bgi/index.php/People/MarkusReichstein) and [Fanny Yang](https://sml.inf.ethz.ch/group/fannyy/).

My research revolves around training deep neural networks on data of the Earth system. Currently I am especially focusing on two applications. On the hand, I am interested in the applicability of large-scale AI for Early Warning Systems. Within the [EarthNet initiative](https://www.earthnet.tech) we are leveraging high resolution satellite imagery to build data-driven impact early warning systems -- with applications to anticipatory action for droughts and heat waves. On the other hand, I study the carbon cycle with neural network emulators. In particular, I am assessing the use of AI for atmospheric transport and inverse modeling -- analogous to how recent works have revolutionized numerical weather prediction.

My research interests are broadly speaking **Deep Learning**, **Biogeochemistry**, **Climate Risk Mitigation** and **Complex Systems**. I believe solving global challenges requires working together. Let us do just that!
